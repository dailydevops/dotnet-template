# Blazor Development Instructions

## General

* MUST write idiomatic and efficient Blazor and C# code.
* MUST follow .NET and Blazor conventions and best practices.
* MUST use Razor Components appropriately for component-based UI development.
* MUST use the latest version C#, currently C# 13 features like record types, pattern matching, and global usings.
* MUST use async/await where applicable to ensure non-blocking UI operations.

## Code Style and Structure

* MUST prefer inline functions for smaller components but separate complex logic into code-behind or service classes.
* MUST structure Blazor components and services following Separation of Concerns principles.
* MUST follow PascalCase for component names, method names, and public members.
* MUST use camelCase for private fields and local variables.
* MUST prefix interface names with "I" (e.g., `IUserService`).

## Component Lifecycle and Data Binding

* MUST utilize Blazor's built-in features for component lifecycle (e.g., `OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`).
* MUST use data binding effectively with `@bind` directive.
* MUST leverage Dependency Injection for services in Blazor components.
* MUST use `EventCallbacks` for handling user interactions efficiently, passing only minimal data when triggering events.

## Performance Optimization

* MUST optimize Razor components by reducing unnecessary renders and using `StateHasChanged()` efficiently.
* MUST minimize the component render tree by avoiding re-renders unless necessary, using `ShouldRender()` where appropriate.
* MUST use asynchronous methods (`async`/`await`) for API calls or UI actions that could block the main thread.
* MUST utilize Blazor server-side or WebAssembly optimally based on the project requirements.

## Error Handling and Validation

* MUST implement proper error handling for Blazor pages and API calls using try-catch blocks.
* MUST use logging for error tracking in the backend and consider capturing UI-level errors in Blazor with tools like `ErrorBoundary`.
* MUST implement validation using FluentValidation or DataAnnotations in forms.
* MUST provide proper user feedback in the UI for error conditions.

## Caching Strategies

* MUST implement in-memory caching for frequently used data, especially for Blazor Server apps using `IMemoryCache`.
* MUST utilize `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to cache application state between user sessions for Blazor WebAssembly.
* MUST consider Distributed Cache strategies (like Redis or SQL Server Cache) for larger applications that need shared state.
* MUST cache API calls by storing responses to avoid redundant calls when data is unlikely to change.

## State Management

* MUST use Blazor's built-in Cascading Parameters and EventCallbacks for basic state sharing across components.
* MUST implement advanced state management solutions using libraries like Fluxor or BlazorState when the application grows in complexity.
* MUST use Blazored.LocalStorage or Blazored.SessionStorage for client-side state persistence in Blazor WebAssembly.
* MUST use Scoped Services and the StateContainer pattern for server-side Blazor to manage state within user sessions.

## API Integration

* MUST use `HttpClient` or other appropriate services to communicate with external APIs or backend services.
* MUST implement comprehensive error handling for API calls and provide meaningful user feedback.
* MUST use HTTPS for all web communication and ensure proper CORS policies are implemented.

## Security and Authentication

* MUST implement Authentication and Authorization in Blazor applications where necessary using ASP.NET Identity or JWT tokens.
* MUST ensure proper security measures are in place for API authentication and data protection.
* MUST validate all user inputs and implement proper authorization checks.

## Testing and Debugging

* MUST perform all unit testing and integration testing using Visual Studio Enterprise.
* MUST test Blazor components and services using TUnit (preferred) or xUnit/NUnit/MSTest.
* MUST use appropriate mocking frameworks for testing dependencies.
* MUST debug Blazor UI issues using browser developer tools and Visual Studio's debugging tools.
* MUST use Visual Studio's diagnostics tools for performance profiling and optimization.

## Documentation

* MUST use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation for backend API services.
* MUST ensure XML documentation for models and API methods to enhance Swagger documentation.
* MUST document complex component logic and business rules for maintainability.
