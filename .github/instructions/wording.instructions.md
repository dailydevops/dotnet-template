# Wording and Writing Style Instructions

## General Style

* MUST use clear, concise, and direct language.
* MUST maintain a consistent formal, professional tone throughout all documentation.
* MUST use active voice rather than passive voice (e.g., "Use this pattern" instead of "This pattern should be used").
* MUST use present tense for instructions and guidelines.
* MUST format headings using Title Case.
* MUST format all documentation in proper Markdown.

## Directive Language

* MUST use modal verbs to indicate requirements clearly:
  - **MUST**: Required, mandatory action or rule
  - **SHOULD**: Recommended action but not mandatory
  - **MAY**: Optional action
  - **MUST NOT** or **MUST NEVER**: Prohibited action
* MUST place the directive at the beginning of the bullet point or sentence.
* MUST maintain consistent formatting of directives (all caps).

## Instruction Files

* MUST include a YAML frontmatter section with `applyTo` and `description` fields.
* MUST organize content under clear, hierarchical headings.
* MUST use bullet points for individual instructions within each section.
* MUST provide concrete examples where appropriate.
* MUST use code formatting (backticks) for code, file names, and technical terms.
* MUST include both general principles and specific implementation details.

## Decision Documents

* MUST follow the established ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format.
* MUST include all required frontmatter fields: authors, applyTo, created, lastModified, state.
* MUST provide clear context and problem statements.
* MUST explicitly state the decision and its implications.
* MUST use consistent terminology when referring to technical concepts.

## Copilot Instructions

* MUST structure guidance as imperative statements.
* MUST group related instructions under appropriate section headings.
* MUST explicitly state constraints and limitations.
* MUST reference specific file paths, folders, or patterns when applicable.
* MUST include cross-references to related decisions or instruction files when appropriate.

## Examples and References

* MUST use code blocks with appropriate language specifiers for code examples.
* MUST use relative links when referencing other documents within the repository.
* SHOULD include brief explanatory comments for complex code examples.
* SHOULD provide references to external resources when applicable.

## Formatting Conventions

* MUST use a single blank line to separate paragraphs.
* MUST use a single blank line before and after lists, code blocks, and headings.
* MUST use consistent indentation (2 spaces) for nested list items.
* MUST use consistent bullet point symbols (* for primary bullets, - for secondary).
* MUST use proper nesting of headings (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections).
