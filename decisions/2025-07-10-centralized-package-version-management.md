# Decision: Centralized Package Version Management with ManagePackageVersionsCentrally

We have decided to enable centralized package version management across the entire solution by setting `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` to `true` in the `Directory.Packages.props` file.

## Context

In multi-project .NET solutions, managing NuGet package versions can become challenging and error-prone. Common issues include:

- **Version Inconsistencies**: Different projects in the same solution referencing different versions of the same package, leading to potential compatibility issues and unexpected behavior.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Updating package versions requires modifying multiple project files individually, increasing the risk of missing updates or introducing inconsistencies.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Transitive dependencies can introduce version conflicts when projects use different versions of packages that depend on the same underlying libraries.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Difficulty in ensuring all projects use the latest secure versions of packages across the entire solution.
- **Build and Runtime Issues**: Version mismatches can cause build failures, runtime exceptions, or subtle bugs that are difficult to diagnose.

Our template-dotnet project serves as a foundation for multiple .NET projects and needs to establish consistent package management practices from the start.

## Decision

We have implemented centralized package version management by:

1. **Enabling `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally`**: Set to `true` in `Directory.Packages.props` to enable MSBuild's central package management feature.
2. **Enabling `CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled`**: Set to `true` to ensure transitive dependencies are also managed centrally and pinned to specific versions.
3. **Defining Global Package References**: All common packages (analyzers, build tools, etc.) are defined once in `Directory.Packages.props` with specific versions.
4. **Version-only Management**: Individual project files reference packages without version numbers, with versions controlled centrally.

This approach ensures that all projects in the solution use consistent package versions while maintaining a single source of truth for version management.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Consistency**: All projects in the solution use the same versions of shared packages, eliminating version conflicts.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Package updates only require changes in one location (`Directory.Packages.props`).
- **Better Security Posture**: Easier to ensure all projects use the latest secure versions of packages.
- **Reduced Build Issues**: Eliminates version-related build failures and runtime conflicts.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Developers don't need to worry about package versions when adding references to existing packages.
- **Transitive Dependency Control**: With `CentralPackageTransitivePinningEnabled`, even indirect dependencies are controlled and predictable.

### Potential Negative Consequences

- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with central package management may need time to adapt.
- **Flexibility Reduction**: Individual projects cannot override package versions without modifying the central configuration.
- **Migration Complexity**: Existing projects may require significant changes to adopt this pattern.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional Per-Project Package Management

**Description**: Allow each project to manage its own package versions independently.

**Why Not Chosen**: 
- Leads to version inconsistencies across the solution
- Increases maintenance overhead
- Higher risk of dependency conflicts
- Difficult to ensure security updates are applied consistently

### 2. Shared MSBuild Props Files Without Central Management

**Description**: Use shared `.props` files to define common package versions but still reference versions in individual projects.

**Why Not Chosen**:
- Still requires version references in each project file
- More complex to implement and maintain
- Doesn't leverage MSBuild's built-in central package management features
- Less enforceable than the native MSBuild approach

### 3. Package Version Variables

**Description**: Define package versions as MSBuild properties and reference them in individual projects.

**Why Not Chosen**:
- Verbose syntax in project files
- No built-in tooling support
- More error-prone than the centralized approach
- Doesn't address transitive dependency management
