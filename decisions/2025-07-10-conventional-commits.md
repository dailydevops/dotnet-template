# Conventional Commits

A decision to adopt the Conventional Commits specification for standardizing commit messages across the project to improve automation, semantic versioning, and change communication.

## Context

The project currently lacks a standardized approach to commit messages, which creates several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent commit history**: Developers use different styles and formats for commit messages, making it difficult to understand the nature and impact of changes
2. **Manual versioning**: Without structured commit messages, determining semantic version bumps requires manual analysis of changes
3. **Changelog generation**: Creating release notes and changelogs is a manual process that is time-consuming and error-prone
4. **Automated tooling limitations**: The lack of structured commit messages prevents the use of automated tools for CI/CD, semantic versioning, and release management
5. **Communication gaps**: Unclear commit messages make it difficult for team members and stakeholders to understand the impact of changes

The project already uses GitVersion (as evidenced by `GitVersion.MsBuild` in `Directory.Packages.props`) and follows centralized package management, indicating a preference for automation and structured development practices.

## Decision

We will adopt the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages in this project.

**Commit Message Structure:**
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Required Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning)
- `fix`: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning)
- `BREAKING CHANGE`: Breaking API changes (correlates with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning)

**Recommended Additional Types:**
- `build`: Changes to build system or external dependencies
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks that don't modify src or test files
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Commits MUST be prefixed with a type followed by an optional scope, optional `!`, and required terminal colon and space
- Breaking changes MUST be indicated either by `!` after the type/scope or by including `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer
- Scope MAY be provided to give additional context (e.g., `feat(api):`, `fix(parser):`)
- Description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix
- Body and footers are OPTIONAL and provide additional context when needed

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
1. **Automated versioning**: GitVersion and other tools can automatically determine semantic version bumps based on commit types
2. **Automated changelog generation**: Tools can automatically generate changelogs and release notes from structured commit messages
3. **Improved communication**: Clear, structured commit messages help team members and stakeholders understand the nature and impact of changes
4. **Better CI/CD integration**: Automated tools can trigger appropriate build and deployment processes based on commit types
5. **Consistent commit history**: Standardized format makes the project history more readable and searchable
6. **Enhanced collaboration**: New contributors can quickly understand the commit convention and follow established patterns

**Potential Challenges:**
1. **Learning curve**: Team members need to learn and remember the conventional commit format
2. **Enforcement overhead**: Initial effort required to establish tooling and processes to enforce the convention
3. **Commit message length**: Some developers may need to adjust to writing more descriptive commit messages
4. **Retroactive application**: Existing commit history will not follow the convention, creating inconsistency in historical data

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement commit message linting tools to validate format automatically
- Provide training and documentation for team members
- Use commit message templates in development environments
- Consider squash-and-merge workflow for pull requests to allow maintainers to create properly formatted commit messages

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Custom Commit Convention

**Description**: Develop a project-specific commit message convention tailored to our needs.

**Pros**: Complete control over format and requirements, can be optimized for specific project needs

**Cons**: Requires documentation and training, no existing tooling support, reinventing the wheel, lacks community standards

**Rejection Reason**: Conventional Commits is already a well-established standard with extensive tooling support

### 2. Continue with Free-form Commit Messages

**Description**: Maintain the current approach of allowing developers to write commit messages without specific formatting requirements.

**Pros**: No learning curve, no enforcement overhead, developer freedom

**Cons**: Inconsistent history, no automation benefits, poor communication, manual versioning and changelog generation

**Rejection Reason**: Does not address the identified problems and prevents automation benefits

### 3. GitHub Flow with Descriptive PR Titles

**Description**: Focus on descriptive pull request titles and use squash merging to create clean commit messages.

**Pros**: Reduces individual commit message burden, maintains clean main branch history

**Cons**: Still lacks standardization, no automation benefits, requires manual formatting of squash commit messages

**Rejection Reason**: Does not provide the structured format needed for automation tools

### 4. Semantic Commit Messages (Alternative Format)

**Description**: Use alternative structured commit formats like Angular commit convention or other semantic formats.

**Pros**: Similar benefits to Conventional Commits, some tooling support

**Cons**: Less standardized than Conventional Commits, smaller ecosystem, potential compatibility issues

**Rejection Reason**: Conventional Commits is more widely adopted and has better tooling ecosystem

- [Centralized Package Version Management](./2025-07-10-centralized-package-version-management.md) - The adoption of centralized package management demonstrates the project's commitment to automation and standardization, which aligns with adopting Conventional Commits for automated versioning and release management
- [GitVersion for Automated Semantic Versioning](./2025-07-10-gitversion-automated-semantic-versioning.md) - GitVersion is configured to parse conventional commit messages and automatically determine semantic version increments, making conventional commits essential for automated versioning to work correctly
