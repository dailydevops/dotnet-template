# Decision: Dependabot for Automated Dependency Updates

We have decided to implement Dependabot for automated dependency updates across both NuGet packages and GitHub Actions to maintain security, stability, and currency of our dependencies.

## Context

Managing dependencies in modern software projects presents several challenges:

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities that expose the project to risks.
- **Manual Update Overhead**: Manually tracking and updating dependencies across multiple package ecosystems (NuGet, GitHub Actions) is time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Dependency Drift**: Over time, projects tend to fall behind on dependency updates, making future updates more risky and complex.
- **Breaking Changes**: Delayed updates can result in larger version jumps with more breaking changes, making updates more difficult.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many organizations require keeping dependencies current for security and compliance reasons.
- **Developer Productivity**: Outdated dependencies may lack performance improvements, bug fixes, and new features that could benefit development.

Our template-dotnet project needs a systematic approach to dependency management that ensures security while minimizing maintenance burden.

## Decision

We have implemented Dependabot with the following configuration:

1. **NuGet Package Ecosystem**:
   - Daily update schedule for timely security patches
   - Conventional commit format with "chore(deps)" prefix
   - Grouped updates for related packages (coverlet, testcontainers, tunit, verify, xunit)
   - Pull request limit of 10 to prevent overwhelming the repository
   - Automatic assignment to maintainers for review

2. **GitHub Actions Ecosystem**:
   - Daily update schedule for workflow security
   - Conventional commit format with "chore(ci)" prefix
   - Automatic assignment to maintainers for review

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Centralized configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml`
   - Consistent labeling for dependency tracking
   - Integration with existing centralized package management

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Enhanced Security**: Automatic detection and updates for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Eliminates the need for manual dependency monitoring and update initiation.
- **Consistent Updates**: Regular, small updates are easier to review and integrate than large, infrequent updates.
- **Improved Visibility**: Pull requests provide clear visibility into what dependencies are being updated and why.
- **Better Compliance**: Systematic approach to keeping dependencies current supports security and compliance requirements.
- **Grouped Updates**: Related packages are updated together, reducing the number of individual pull requests.
- **Integration with Workflow**: Uses conventional commits and proper labeling to integrate with existing development processes.

### Potential Negative Consequences

- **Pull Request Volume**: Daily updates may generate significant pull request activity, requiring regular maintenance.
- **False Positives**: Some updates may introduce issues that require rollback or additional testing.
- **Breaking Changes**: Automatic updates may occasionally include breaking changes requiring code modifications.
- **Review Overhead**: Each update requires human review to ensure compatibility and correctness.
- **Test Dependencies**: Effectiveness depends on having comprehensive test coverage to catch regressions.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Rely on automated test suites to catch issues introduced by dependency updates.
- **Gradual Rollout**: Monitor update patterns and adjust configuration based on experience.
- **Grouping Strategy**: Use package grouping to reduce the number of individual pull requests.
- **Review Process**: Establish clear review criteria for dependency updates.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Manual Dependency Management

**Description**: Manually monitor and update dependencies on a periodic basis.

**Why Not Chosen**: 
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Inconsistent update frequency
- Higher risk of missing critical security updates
- Scales poorly with project growth

### 2. Automated Dependency Scanning Only

**Description**: Use tools that scan for vulnerabilities but don't automatically create updates.

**Why Not Chosen**:
- Provides visibility but still requires manual update process
- Doesn't address the maintenance overhead of dependency updates
- May lead to delayed responses to security issues

### 3. Weekly or Monthly Update Schedule

**Description**: Configure Dependabot to run less frequently.

**Why Not Chosen**:
- Slower response to security vulnerabilities
- Larger batch updates are more complex to review
- May accumulate breaking changes over time

### 4. Alternative Dependency Management Tools

**Description**: Use tools like WhiteSource, or Snyk for dependency management.

**Why Not Chosen**:
- Dependabot is native to GitHub and integrates seamlessly
- No additional third-party service dependencies
- Simpler configuration and maintenance
- Cost considerations for commercial alternatives
