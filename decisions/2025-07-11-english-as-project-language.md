# English as Project Language

A decision to establish English as the primary and mandatory language for all code, documentation, and written content within the project to ensure consistency, professionalism, and global accessibility.

## Context

Software development projects often face challenges with language consistency, especially in international teams or when targeting global audiences. Mixed language usage in codebases can lead to several issues:

1. **Inconsistent Communication**: Using multiple languages creates confusion and reduces readability for team members who may not be fluent in all languages used
2. **Maintenance Complexity**: Mixed language comments, documentation, and variable names make code maintenance more difficult
3. **Global Collaboration**: Non-English content can exclude potential contributors and limit the project's reach
4. **Professional Standards**: Industry best practices favor English as the standard language for software development
5. **Tool Compatibility**: Many development tools, IDEs, and automated systems work better with English content
6. **Documentation Accessibility**: English documentation ensures broader accessibility for users and contributors worldwide

## Decision

All code, documentation, comments, and other written content in this project MUST be written in English. This includes:

- **Source Code**: All variable names, function names, class names, method names, and other identifiers
- **Code Comments**: All inline comments, documentation comments, and code annotations
- **Documentation**: README files, API documentation, user guides, and technical specifications
- **Commit Messages**: All commit messages must follow the established Conventional Commits format in English
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub issues, pull request descriptions, and discussions
- **Configuration Files**: Comments and descriptions in configuration files
- **Database Objects**: Table names, column names, stored procedure names, and database documentation

The English used should be:
- **Professional**: Use clear, concise, and professional language
- **Consistent**: Follow established naming conventions and terminology
- **Accessible**: Avoid unnecessary jargon and use plain English where possible

## Consequences

### Benefits

1. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members from different linguistic backgrounds can effectively collaborate
2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Consistent language usage makes code easier to read, understand, and maintain
3. **Global Accessibility**: English content ensures the project is accessible to the widest possible audience
4. **Professional Standards**: Aligns with industry best practices and professional development standards
5. **Tool Integration**: Better compatibility with development tools, linters, and automated systems
6. **Knowledge Transfer**: Easier onboarding of new team members regardless of their native language
7. **Open Source Readiness**: Prepares the project for potential open-source contributions

### Trade-offs

1. **Learning Curve**: Team members who are not native English speakers may need additional time to express complex technical concepts
2. **Translation Overhead**: Existing non-English content will need to be translated during migration
3. **Cultural Context**: Some domain-specific terms or concepts may lose nuance when translated to English

### Risks

1. **Initial Productivity Impact**: Short-term productivity decrease while team members adapt to English-only communication
2. **Quality Concerns**: Non-native English speakers may initially produce less polished documentation or comments

## Alternatives Considered

### Multi-language Approach
- **Description**: Allow multiple languages based on team member preferences or regional requirements
- **Rejected Because**: Creates inconsistency, reduces maintainability, and limits global collaboration

### Native Language with English Translation
- **Description**: Write in native language first, then translate to English
- **Rejected Because**: Increases maintenance overhead, creates potential for translation errors, and delays development

### Gradual Migration
- **Description**: Slowly transition to English over time without enforcing immediate compliance
- **Rejected Because**: Would result in inconsistent codebase for extended periods and may never achieve full compliance
